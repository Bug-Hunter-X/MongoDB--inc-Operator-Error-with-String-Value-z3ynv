# MongoDB $inc Operator Error with String Value

This repository demonstrates a common error when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB queries. The `$inc` operator is used to increment a numerical field in a document.  However, if you provide a string value as the increment, MongoDB will throw an error.

The `bug.js` file shows the incorrect usage.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.  This example highlights the importance of using the correct data types when interacting with MongoDB.
